## Awesome Animal Pick

I choose the [Red-lipped Batfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-lipped_batfish), because it has bright red lips, which looks awesome to me. It also has an interesting body part called an illicium on its head that extends outward for attracting prey. Also, its face seems a little unhappy, which is cute and funny.
