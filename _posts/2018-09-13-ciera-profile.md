## Biography 

**Ciera Martinez** is a biologist who spent the last ten years studying the evolution of morphology.  During her PhD she explored how plant form develops and now aims to understand how non-coding DNA defines developmental signals during early fruit fly development. She is a Berkeley Institute of Data Science Fellow where she explores her love of all things data. And really likes fancy microscopes and cats.

## Skills

Ciera knows a lot about Plant Biology, Evolution, R, and knitting.

## Awesome Animal Pick

I choose the [Okapi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi), because it looks like a mix between a two other awesome animals - zebras and giraffes. Also, being an evolutionary biologist I love all organisms considered to be exaples of  "[living fossils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_fossil)"
